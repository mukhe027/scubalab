# Scaling Collaborative Unmanned roBots for Autonomy Lab is a robotics lab in the Ocean and Mechanical Engineering (OME) department of Florida Atlantic University (FAU). The lab is situated in the SeaTech campus of FAU. The research focus of this lab is to develop novel multi-robot topology control algorithms by applying state-of-the-art machine learning models to ease the scaling of multi-robot teams.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We develop state-of-the-art multi-robot topology control algorithms and apply it to real robots. We believe in taking a multi-tiered approach: i) develop robust theory; ii) test with high fidelity simulations; iii) make real robots work in real world environments.
